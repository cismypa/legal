## 2 What is this document all about?

It is about the protection of the privacy of your data.

We will thoroughly explain what that means, concerning all of the following areas:

* generally
* when visiting and using this website
* when visiting and using other websites run by Cismypa
* when installing and using software, including apps, distributed under the name of Cismypa

For each of the areas of application deviating from generality you will find uniquely denoted sections. For example applying this document to websites you would have to read:

* the whole document, except for sections having "app(s)" or "software" appearing in their title
* additionally sections, captioned with "website(s)"
* perhaps sections addressing a specific website

According to [GDPR Art. 12 s. 1](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/), general data protection regulation, it is our duty to inform you in a clear and comprehensible manner about various articles of this complex general data protection regulation. Especially about your rights and the usage of your private data by us.

Aside from this law, for us this is a serious topic anyway. Basic and honest intention is to getting along even completely without any personal data of yours. The very few exceptions to that we are going to explain here as thoroughly as possible.

### 2.1 Security of your data, especially against third-party attack

Also we are always after using the latest software versions with accordingly high security standards in order to prevent illegal data collection and abuse by others.

But please note that technologically no one can guarantee 100% security for data transfers and storage on the internet.

## 3 Data we collect from you

According to [GDPR Art. 13](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/) / [GDPR Art. 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/).

### 3.1 Generally

The technologies used by us are capable of collecting the following data:

* IP address of your computer or mobile device (a unique address on the internet)
* date and time of data requests over the internet
* specific contents and files requested by you
* operating system (-version) of your computer or mobile device
* your internet browser's version
* internet address from where you got to our website or to the offer page of a software/app

which is just common technical data. There is no collection of private data like name, age, sex, address or other contact information whatsoever so far.

The listed technical data we might occasionally use for the following reasons:

* recognition and analysis of technical bugs on our side or of hostile attacks (usually by robots)
* improvement and adaption of our offers in the sense of reasonable support of browsers and devices

which at most is usage in the moderate sense of [GDPR Art. 6 s. 1 lit. f](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/).

### 3.2 When visiting/using our websites

#### 3.2.1 Cookies

Cookies are tiny text files with little information that are sent from a website to your browser and are stored on your device, just to be read again from there later.

We directly only use the most harmless manifestation of so-called session cookies. Those only prevent you from the annoying need to log in over and over after doing it once.

Indirectly over third-party service providers, that we use, additional cookies are sent, cf. 5.2 and subsections.

You can adjust your browser settings to deny all or certain cookies, or to get informed or asked about whether you agree or disagree.

#### 3.2.2 Data transfer

We cannot prevent your data being moved over the internet to servers in other countries, be it temporary or for extended storage time. Data privacy policies can be different there.

If you are not located in Germany, please be aware that your data will be moved to Germany and will be processed there.

#### 3.2.3 Links to other websites

Our web pages contain links to other websites where you are forwarded to when clicking. We obviously do not have any control over the content of those sites. Probably also different privacy policies hold true there, which you need to investigate yourself again.

### 3.3 When installing or using our apps

Just installing an app is regarded as acceptance of this privacy policy and its app specific parts.

More interestingly you can also quit your approval anytime by simply uninstalling.

Our apps are distributed over popular app stores, that is by third-party service providers. So there is no direct individual related customer relationship regarding the buying transaction.

Additionally to the technical data from 3.1 and for the same purpose the following data can be transferred to us when installing/using an app:

- The unique device identification number of your mobile device.
- In the error case (crash) we can view log files from your device, if you agreed on transmission.

In periodic intervals the mentioned data is anonymously aggregated and processed by the third-party provider of the app store (cf. 3.2.1 and 5.2). The necessary transmisson by the way is not done by the app itself but by the underlying operating system.

The app itself does not initiate any data transmission at all, since at the moment exclusively apps without any need of internet connection are offered.
This means especially that every data you type into the app is saved on the device locally only. It is not viewable by us from the outside.

Also there is no collection of GPS data, meaning your position is not recognizable for us by that.

Within the app store there is the possibility to leave comments and ratings regarding our apps. For that the privacy policies of the respective stores have to be taken into account (cf. 3.2.1).
We want to point out that everything that you leave there can be publicly visible, together with your user alias or real name.

#### 3.2.1 Links to the privacy policies of the utilized app stores

- [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)
- [Google Play Store](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Microsoft Store](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement) (Windows apps)
